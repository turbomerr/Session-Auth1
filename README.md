# Authentication Using Node.js, Sessions, and Cookies

This is the refactored and cleaned code from the **"Understanding Authentication in Node.js using Sessions and Cookies"** project.

In this project, I aimed to keep things simple and focus on solidifying the concepts behind using Sessions and Cookies for Authentication. The code has been refactored from the original version in the video to make it more readable and easier to review.
